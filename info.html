        <h2>Time <i>&</i> Date</h2>
        <p><strong>3:30pm‚Äì10:30pm, Saturday 27<sup>th</sup> April 2023</strong> at <strong>Estate Vaucluse House, Sydney.</strong></p>
        <p> 
          We ask that you arrive promptly at 3:30pm. The ceremony will be held on the Lone Pine Lawn, or‚Äîin the event of inclement weather‚Äîwe'll retreat under the verandah of Vaucluse House itself. 
          The ceremony will conclude at 4:30pm, followed by cake and champagne on the lawns. 
          From 5:30pm, there will be an opportunity for photos as we head across the garden to the reception. The reception is a share-plate dinner in the restaurant on the grounds, where we'll enjoy a long night of eating, dancing, and celebrating!

        <h2>Dress Code</h2>
        <p>
          The dress code is formal, with tuxedos encouraged. 
          Consider this an opportunity to get dressed up with us! Black tie attire will not be out of place.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Gents</strong>: Dust off those tuxedos and pull out your best clip on bow tie, or‚Äîif you're not feeling it, that's fine too‚Äîa dark suit is a great option. 
          If ties aren't you're thing, go without (they'll probably come off on the dance floor anyway).
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Ladies</strong>: Here's the excuse you've been looking for to finally wear / buy that outfit. 
          If you're looking for specifics, here they are: pants / skirts / jumpsuits are all welcomed (even tuxedos, if you'd prefer!), any length dress is fine, and no colours are off limits, except white. 
          Be aware that the ceremony will be on grass, so choose your shoes appropriately.
        </p>

        <h2>Transport</h2>
        <p>The venue is located at <strong>69A Wentworth Rd, Vaucluse, NSW 2030.</strong></p>
        <p>There is a carpark on site, as well as plenty of free parking along Wentworth Road for those choosing to drive.
           The 325 bus runs right outside, heading to or from Circular Quay (with the last bus home passing by at around 11pm).
           If you're planning to get a taxi / Uber home, we'd recommend pre-booking the pick up.
