        <p>The venue is located east of the Sydney CBD, with good motor vehicle access. There is plenty of free parking on site or along Wentworth Road for those choosing to drive. The 325 also runs right outside, heading to or from the Rocks (with the last bus home passing by at around 11pm).</p>

        <p>The ceremony will be held on the Lone Pine Lawn, orâ€”in the event of inclement weatherâ€”we'll retreat under the verandah of Vaucluse House itself. The ceremony will be followed by a short cake and cocktails session, and then an opportunity for photos as we head across the garden to the reception. The reception is a share-plate dinner in the restaurant on the grounds, where we'll enjoy a long night of eating, dancing, and celebrating!</p>
