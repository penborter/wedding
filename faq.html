        <h1>FAQ</h1>
        <h2>When is the RSVP deadline?</h2>
        <p>Please RSVP by March 1st, so we can have an accurate headcount.</p>

        <h2>Do I get a plus one?</h2>
        <p>Check your invitation!</p>

        <h2>What if I have dietary restrictions?</h2>
        <p>Please let us know in your RSVP so we can make sure you're covered.</p>

        <h2>Are we allowed to take our own pictures?</h2>
        <p>Take as many pictures as you want throughout the day, we just ask you hold off during the ceremony.</p>

      <div id="right">
        <h2>Is the wedding indoors?</h2>
        <p>The ceremony will be outdoors (but under cover if it's raining). The reception will be indoors, and the dance floor will be outside under a marquee.</p>

        <h2>Will you be changing your last names?</h2>
        <p>Noâ€”we didn't want to confuse fans of previous hits such as <i>Synthetic Biology Approaches to Hydrocarbon Biosensors: A Review</i> (C. Moratti, 2022).</p>

        <h2>Can I drive?</h2>
        <p>Yes, there is plenty of free parking on site and along Wentworth Road nearby.</p>

        <h2>Any other questions?</h2>
        <p>We have a wedding-specific email addressâ€”<em>hi@claudia-ben.com</em>â€”otherwise, feel free to give either of us a call.</p>
