        <h1>FAQ</h1>
        <h2>When is the RSVP deadline?</h2>
        <p>Please RSVP by March 22<sup>nd</sup>, so we can have an accurate headcount.</p>

        <h2>Do I get a plus one?</h2>
        <p>Check your invitation!</p>

        <h2>What if I have dietary restrictions?</h2>
        <p>Please let us know in your RSVP so we can make sure you're covered.</p>

        <h2>Are we allowed to take our own pictures?</h2>
        <p>Take as many pictures as you want throughout the day, we just ask you hold off during the ceremony. We will have a link to upload photos on the <a href="photos.html">Photos</a> page so everyone can share them.</p>

        <h2>Can I bring my kids?</h2>
        <p>If you'd like to bring your little ones to the wedding, reach out to us to have a chat</p>

        <h2>Is there a registry?</h2>
        <p>We're honoured to have you join us on the day, and the best gift you could give us is your full effort on the dance floor! There will be a wishing well and gift table if you feel so inclined.</p>

      <div id="right">
        <h2>Is the wedding indoors?</h2>
        <p>The ceremony will be outdoors (but under cover if it's raining). The reception will be indoors, and the dance floor will be outside under a marquee.</p>

        <h2>Will you be changing your last names?</h2>
        <p>Not officiallyâ€”we didn't want to confuse fans of previous hits such as <i>Synthetic Biology Approaches to Hydrocarbon Biosensors: A Review</i> (C. Moratti, 2022). Among friends, we'll go by Mr. and Mrs. Porter. Claudia has always dreamt of having multiple identities.</p>

        <h2>Can I drive?</h2>
        <p>Yes, there is plenty of free parking on site and along Wentworth Road nearby. Just note that cars parked in on site parking can't be left overnight.</p>

        <h2>The invitation said "late", but the website says finishing at 10:30pm?</h2>
        <p>10:30pm is correctâ€”that <i>is</i> late (for us).</p>

        <h2>Any other questions?</h2>
        <p>If you have any more questions, feel free to give either of us a call. Otherwise, head back over to the <a href="info.html">Info</a> page.</p>
