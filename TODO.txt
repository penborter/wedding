[ ] Fix invite code validation
    [ ] Alert if code is wrong format (regex)
    [ ] Alert if code is not in list

    [ ] Remove blank spaces from response row so the right number of names are shown
    [ ] Account for cases with plus one

[ ] Add loading indicators:
    [ ] Initial code form
    [ ] Second RSVP form
