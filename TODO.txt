DOING

[/] RSVP page
    [X] Mobile formatting (esp. margin right)
    [X] Updated text - "Enter 6-letter code attached to your invitation"
    [ ] Confirm text (including warnings) with Claudia

[ ] Update 18/02
    [X] Change "plus one" to "guest" in names list spreadsheet
    [ ] Change "loading" for code submit to remove form (so it can be seen above a phone keyboard)


DONE

[X] Fix invite code validation
    [X] Alert if code is wrong format (regex)
    [X] Alert if code is not in list
    [X] Don't show form if no match - doGet should send back "Unsuccessful" message

[X] Correct RSVP form templating:
    [X] Remove blank spaces from response row so the right number of names are shown
    [X] Account for cases with plus one
     -> We can just ask for the name of the plus one if needed, currently not supported
    [X] Link to info page after submission

[X] Added loading indicators:
    [X] Initial code form
    [X] Second RSVP form
     -> Both buttons change to say "loading" once submitted

[ ] More clearly link between pages - RSVP -> Info -> FAQs -> Photos
    [X] Add link to Info page after RSVP form submit
